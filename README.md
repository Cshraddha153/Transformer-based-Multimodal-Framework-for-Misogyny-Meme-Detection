# Transformer-based-Multimodal-Framework-for-Misogyny-Meme-Detection

# Desciption
This research focuses on detecting misogynistic content in Tamil and Malayalam memes using a multimodal approach. We extract image features using ViT (Vision Transformer) and text features using MuRIL, then fuse these features for classification. Both machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models were trained for misogyny detection. The research paper is currently under review at NAACL 2025.

# Methodology
1. Image Feature Extraction: ViT (Vision Transformer)
2. Text Feature Extraction: XLM-Roberta
3. Feature Fusion: Combined visual and textual features for classification
   
# Models Used:
1. Machine Learning Models: KNN, SVM, Random Forest (RF), Na√Øve Bayes (NB)
2. Deep Learning Models: LSTM, GRU, Custom Multimodal Model (MMC)
